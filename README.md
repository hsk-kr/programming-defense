# React Programming Defense

[PLAY!](https://programming-defense-hsk-kr.vercel.app/)

This game is not finished. Since I developed fast without much concerns regarding bugs or code quaility, there might be a lack of performance and many bugs.

Currently, there are level 30 and there is no game over message yet.

## Run the dev server with Docker

```properties
docker compose up
```

You can access the dev server by port 5173, which is a default port of vite dev server.

## Play Guide

- Use the "p" key to create a tower on the top left corner.
- Click on the tower to select it.
- Click on the destination tile to move the tower to the tile.
