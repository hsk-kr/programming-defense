# React Programming Defense

[PLAY!](https://programming-defense-hsk-kr.vercel.app/)

This game is not finished. Since I developed fast without much concerns, there might be a lack of performance and many bugs.

Currently, there are level 30 and there is no game over message yet.

## Guide

- **How to make a tower:** You can pick a random tower by cliking the pick button.
- **My towers don't attack:** Towers are supposed to be specific areas that colored blue. Click your tower and move it to the tile.
